<p>How to aquire a chunk of a market when you only have less than 1% of it? Hire some crazy go nuts thinkers, (that's us). Atomic wanted a piece of the freestyle ski market, the solution we came up with; sell 3 skis, all with unique graphics. The rationale was multifaceted, each consumer could chose a unique style with 3 skis, they will have a spare after ripping the edge off on the rail, and most importantly, 2 roommates buy Triplets, and sell the spare on Ebay, virally spreading the user base. Mission accomplished, the Atomic team were the bad boys with all the cameras on thier booth. They were quite satisfited with this new position.
