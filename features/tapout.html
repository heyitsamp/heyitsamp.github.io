	  is a little mobile game we made quite by accident while doing
	  something else. Since it was fun, we published it! The goal is
	  to make as many taps as you can in five seconds. It's great for
	  challenging friends with newer and better techniques and then
	  bringing them together around a larger phone or tablet for even
	  higher scores.

	  Tap Out has been through three versions, the first two under another
	  name. Version one was implemented in
	  <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>. Version two switched to
	  <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. Seth had that finished a week
	  after picking up Unity and
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">C#</a>
	  for the first time. Version three was a
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">UX</a>
	  pass and brought the game to it's current state where we find people
	  can just pick it up and play with no extra explanation.
