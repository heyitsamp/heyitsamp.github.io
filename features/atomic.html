      <p>How to acquire a chunk of a market when you only have less than 1% of it? Hire some crazy go nuts thinkers, (that's us). Atomic wanted a piece of the freestyle ski market, the solution we came up with was to sell a set 3 skis, each with unique graphics. The rationale was multifaceted; each consumer could chose a unique style with 3 skis, if the skiier rips the edge off on a rail they would have a spare, and most importantly, 2 roommates buy Triplets, and sell the spare to third roomie, or on Ebay, virally spreading the user base. Mission accomplished, the Atomic team were the bad boys with all the cameras on their booth. They were quite satisfied with this new position.</p>
